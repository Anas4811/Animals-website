                <p>Sparrows take dust baths instead of water baths! üõÅ‚ú®

                    Instead of always using water to clean themselves, sparrows love rolling around in dry dirt or sand to remove parasites and keep their feathers in top shape. They kick up dust, shake their feathers, and look like they‚Äôre having a mini spa day! üê¶üí®
